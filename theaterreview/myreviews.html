                <h1>Wicked</h1>
                <img src="./images/Wicked.jpg" alt="Wicked picture">
                <p>Wicked holds a very special place in my heart. I’ve grown up listening 
                    to the music and idealizing Idina Menzel who was casted as the main 
                    protagonist, Elphaba, in the original cast. This story is wonderful 
                    and intriguing in the ways that it fits into the original world of 
                    The Wizard of Oz. It’s a story that I never would have imagined coming 
                    from the world Dorothy found herself in. This play is heartwarming, 
                    and the music is endlessly catching, which is why it’s usually playing 
                    in my head, competing with whatever else I was listening to that day. 
                    I absolutely recommend this play to anyone, theater lovers or not.</p>

                <h1>Dear Evan Hansen</h1>
                <img src="./images/Dear Evan Hansen Playbill.jpg" alt="Dear Evan Hansen Playbill">
                <p>Dear Evan Hansen has been close to my heart ever since I first heard 
                    the music six years ago. This was a touching play that had everyone 
                    in my family in tears by the end. For me it was incredibly relatable 
                    as it deals with themes of loneliness and feeling like no one knows 
                    that you’re there, which are feelings everyone has sometime in their 
                    lives. The music powerfully portrays that “no one is alone” and that 
                    we all have some impact that we make in this world, no matter how big 
                    or small. The play has a lot of profanity and vulgarity, so it isn’t 
                    as high on my list as others, but I highly recommend giving the 
                    soundtrack a listen.</p>

                <h1>Hadestown</h1>
                <img src="./images/Hadestown Playbill.jpg" alt="Hadestown Playbill">
                <p>Hadestown was a surprising musical to me. I didn’t have much prior knowledge 
                    to seeing it, other than a loose understanding of the Greek mythology that 
                    the play features. Although not feeling attached to it before seeing this 
                    musical, I can say that I’m definitely attached afterwards. This has been 
                    added to soundtracks that I listen to on repeat because the music is so 
                    good and different than so many other musicals I’ve heard/seen. It’s a 
                    touching story with an ending that leaves you wanting more. This one is 
                    definitely worth the watch.</p>

                <h1>The Band's Visit</h1>
                <img src="./images/The Band's Visit Playbill.jpg" alt="The Band's Visit Playbill">
                <p>The Band’s Visit was an interesting play. I had heard very little about 
                    it before I saw it, which actually fits well with the theme of the play. 
                    It opens with a message on a projector screen saying, “Once, not long ago, 
                    a group of musicians came to Israel from Egypt. You probably didn’t hear 
                    about it. It wasn’t very important.” This instantly grabbed my attention 
                    and made me excited for the play. This then went on to become one of my 
                    favorites of all time, although most of the people I’ve talked to thought 
                    it boring and dry. These are some of the reasons I loved it so much though. 
                    It was dry and sort of boring, but I think that was on purpose and represented 
                    how our lives feel sometimes. Either way, it was a wonderful play and I would 
                    highly recommend you see it as well to get your own opinion on it.</p>
