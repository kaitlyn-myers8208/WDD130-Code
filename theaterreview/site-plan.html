        writing and performing them. This is for anyone who has had any interest in musicals or plays.</p>


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>My intended audience is those who have a passion for theater or those who are skeptical of it. Anyone who wants to learn more

        Welcome to my page! Here I hope to share the love that I have for 
        musicals and plays and help you to develop your love for them as well!
        I’ve grown up going to plays and listening to their soundtracks on any 
        road trips with my family, so they’ve always been apart of my life. 
        In more recent years however, I’ve been able to see one or two plays 
        a month with my family. Theater has always been something I’ve loved, 
        but experiencing it more thoroughly in my life has helped me grow to 
        appreciate the work that goes into the productions and the storylines.

      <h3>Musical Synopses</h3>
      <p>
        Dear Evan Hansen
        "Dear Evan Hansen" is a Tony Award-winning Broadway musical that tells 
        the story of a high school student named Evan Hansen who struggles with 
        social anxiety and a desire to fit in. After the death of a classmate, 
        Evan is mistaken as his best friend and becomes entangled in a web of lies 
        that brings him closer to the boy's family and changes the course of 
        his life. As Evan's popularity grows, he must navigate the consequences 
        of his actions and confront the truth about his own identity and relationships. 
        Through powerful music and heartfelt storytelling, "Dear Evan Hansen" explores 
        themes of mental health, friendship, and the complexities of modern-day communication.

        Hadestown
        "Hadestown" is a Tony Award-winning Broadway musical that reimagines the myth of Orpheus 
        and Eurydice as a post-apocalyptic love story. Set in the underworld of Greek mythology, 
        the show follows Orpheus, a struggling musician, and Eurydice, a young woman who has lost 
        her way. As they journey to the depths of Hadestown to seek a better life, they encounter 
        the powerful ruler of the underworld, Hades, and his wife, Persephone. Through mesmerizing 
        music and innovative staging, "Hadestown" explores themes of love, loss, and the struggle 
        for hope in a world that often feels bleak. The show features a mix of jazz, blues, and 
        folk music, as well as dynamic choreography and a talented cast that brings the story to 
        life with passion and energy.

        Wicked
        "Wicked" is a beloved Broadway musical that reimagines the classic story of "The 
        Wizard of Oz" from the perspective of the witches. The show follows the unlikely 
        friendship between two witches, Glinda the Good and Elphaba the Wicked, as they 
        navigate their way through school and the political turmoil of Oz. As they grow 
        closer, they begin to uncover the truth behind the wizard's rule and the persecution 
        of those with magical abilities. Through powerful music and witty storytelling, 
        "Wicked" explores themes of friendship, love, and the struggle for acceptance in a 
        world that values conformity.

        The Band’s Visit
        "The Band's Visit" is a Tony Award-winning Broadway musical that tells the story of 
        an Egyptian police band that gets stranded in a small Israeli town. The band members 
        are forced to spend the night in the town, and the locals take them in, offering food 
        and shelter. As the night unfolds, both the band members and the townspeople learn about 
        each other's cultures and connect through music and shared experiences. Through a mix 
        of humor and heart, "The Band's Visit" explores themes of loneliness, connection, and 
        the power of music to bring people together. The show features a beautiful score that 
        blends traditional Middle Eastern music with contemporary Broadway influences, as well 
        as a talented cast that brings the characters to life with warmth and depth.

      <h3>My Reviews</h3>
      <p>
        Dear Evan Hansen has been close to my heart ever since I first heard the music six years 
        ago. This was a touching play that had everyone in my family in tears by the end. For 
        me it was incredibly relatable as it deals with themes of loneliness and feeling like 
        no one knows that you’re there, which are feelings everyone has sometime in their lives. 
        The music powerfully portrays that “no one is alone” and that we all have some impact 
        that we make in this world, no matter how big or small. The play has a lot of profanity 
        and vulgarity, so it isn’t as high on my list as others, but I highly recommend giving 
        the soundtrack a listen.

        Hadestown was a surprising musical to me. I didn’t have much prior knowledge to seeing 
        it, other than a loose understanding of the Greek mythology that the play features. 
        Although not feeling attached to it before seeing this musical, I can say that I’m 
        definitely attached afterwards. This has been added to soundtracks that I listen to on 
        repeat because the music is so good and different than so many other musicals I’ve 
        heard/seen. It’s a touching story with an ending that leaves you wanting more. This 
        one is definitely worth the watch.

        Wicked holds a very special place in my heart. I’ve grown up listening to the music 
        and idealizing Idina Menzel who was casted as the main protagonist, Elphaba, in the 
        original cast. This story is wonderful and intriguing in the ways that it fits into 
        the original world of The Wizard of Oz. It’s a story that I never would have imagined 
        coming from the world Dorothy found herself in. This play is heartwarming, and the 
        music is endlessly catching, which is why it’s usually playing in my head, competing 
        with whatever else I was listening to that day. I absolutely recommend this play to 
        anyone, theater lovers or not.

        The Band’s Visit was an interesting play. I had heard very little about it before I 
        saw it, which actually fits well with the theme of the play. It opens with a message 
        on a projector screen saying, “Once, not long ago, a group of musicians came to Israel 
        from Egypt. You probably didn’t hear about it. It wasn’t very important.” This instantly 
        grabbed my attention and made me excited for the play. This then went on to become one 
        of my favorites of all time, although most of the people I’ve talked to thought it 
        boring and dry. These are some of the reasons I loved it so much though. It was dry and 
        sort of boring, but I think that was on purpose and represented how our lives feel 
        sometimes. Either way, it was a wonderful play and I would highly recommend you see 
        it as well to get your own opinion on it.
